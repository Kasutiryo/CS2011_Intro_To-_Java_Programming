If you aren't a Legend of Zelda fan, (and really how can you NOT be ^_^), feel free to find another piece of
ASCII art online that you like and print that instead.
HINT: For this one it is easier to start from the bottom and work your way up line by line. to get the alignment
correct.
HINT: The characters used in the above piece of art are as follows: _ (underscore) | (vertical pipe, usually found
on the backslash key) # (pound or hash symbol) \ (backslash) / (forward slash). Note that the underscore is used
multiple times in a row to create longer horizontal lines. Also NOTE: If you want to print a backslash in Java
you need to print two right next to each other without a space in between for example: "\\". We will discuss
why this is next week.
Example: to print the bottom line of the picture you would put the following in your code:
System.out.println("/_____________________\\__\\)"
Which would print: /_____________________\__\
Again, note the use of the double \ in the print statement. This is required for all backslashes.
