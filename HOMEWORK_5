Problem 01: Area of a Hexagon (5 points)

Write a program which asks the user for the length of one of the sides (s) of a hexagon and computes its area.  
Use the following formula:

area=6s24tan(π6)area=6s24tan(π6)

Input Validation:

Side length cannot be negative.
Requirements:

Round the output to 3 decimal places.
Sample Output

Enter the length of a side of the hexagon: 10.79

Area is 302.478684638 
Problem 02: Four Cities Area (5 points)

Write a program to compute the area between the four cities of: Atlanta, Georgia; Charlotte, North Carolina; 
Savannah, Georgia; and Orlando, Florida. You will need to use the Great Circle Distance Formula to compute the 
distance between two cities.  Use the given website to lookup to GPS coordinates for each of the four cities.  
Use the given formulas to compute the area.  Refer to the map for the general shape of the area.


Formulas and Other Information:

distance=radius×arccos(sin(x1)×sin(x2)+cos(x1)×cos(x2)×cos(y1−y2))
The GPS coordinates for each city can be found using this website: GPS Coordinate Finder
radius of earth = 6371.01 km
s=(side1+side2+side3)/2
triangle area=s(s−side1)(s−side2)(s−side3)

The map may be useful for picturing the area:



Input Validation:

None required, no user input.
Requirements:

The GPS coordinates must be stored as constants in your program.
The radius of the earth must be stored as a constant in your program.
Round the output to 4 decimal places.
NOTE: The shape is a four sided polygon, not a triangle, think this problem through very carefully.

HINT: The following are the five distances that you need to calculate to solve the problem.  Check your distances
against mine.  You are NOT allowed to hard code these distances.  You must let your program compute them.

Atlanta to Charlotte Distance:   	364.06527348474543 km
Charlotte to Savannah Distance:	350.3530739761958 km
Savannah to Orlando Distance:  	395.1202330987338 km
Orlando to Atlanta Distance:    	646.1971341531463 km
Atlanta to Savannah Distance:	358.4399024929256 km
Sample Output

The area of the four cities is: 117863.3417 kms squared.
Problem 03: Character Converter (5 points)

Create a menu-driven program that converts a character between its Unicode value and vice versa.  The menu should 
have the following options:

a. Convert Character to Unicode
b. Convert Unicode to Character
c. Exit Program

Allow the user to choose a menu choice and enter a character or Unicode value and convert the input respectively.

Input Validation:

The menu choices must be valid.
The menu choices should use characters for the choices, instead of numbers.
The Unicode value entered must not be negative.
HINT: To read a single character from the console use the following command with your Scanner variable.

.next().charAt(0)

Problem 04: Character Analysis (5 points)

Write a program that has the user enter a character and displays some information about the character based on the following rules:

Say whether or not the character is a letter, digit, or non-alphanumeric.
If the character is a letter, say whether or not it is uppercase or lowercase
Input Validation:

None required.
Sample Output 1

Enter a character: j
lowercase letter
Sample Output 2

Enter a character: #
non-alphanumeric
Sample Output 3

Enter a character: O
uppercase letter
Sample Output 4

Enter a character: 6
digit
