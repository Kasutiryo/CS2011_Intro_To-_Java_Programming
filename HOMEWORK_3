Write a program that reads a floating-­point number and prints "zero" if the number is zero. Otherwise, print "positive"
or "negative". Add “small” if the absolute value of the number is less than 1, or "large" if it exceeds 1,000,000.

Sample Output 1:
Enter a floating-point number: 0
zero

Sample Output 2:
Enter a floating-point number: 0.2637
small, positive

Sample Output 3:
Enter a floating-point number: -1234567
large, negative

Sample Output 4:
Enter a floating-point number: -42.29645
negative

Sample Output 5:
Enter a floating-point number: 367.27
positive

Problem 02: Quadratic Equation Solver (5 points)

The two roots of a quadratic equation ax2+bx+c=0ax2+bx+c=0 can be obtained using the following formula:

r1=−b+b2−4ac√2ar1=−b+b2−4ac2a                                    r2=−b−b2−4ac√2ar2=−b−b2−4ac2a

b2−4acb2−4ac is called the discriminant of the quadratic equation. If it is positive, the equation has two real 
roots. If it is zero, the equation has one root. If it is negative, the equation has no real roots. Write a program 
that prompts the user to enter values for a, b, and c and displays
the result based on the discriminant. If the discriminant is positive, display two roots. If the discriminant is 0,
display one root. Otherwise, display "The equation has no real roots".

Sample Output 1:

Enter the a, b, and c: 1.0 3.0 1.0
The equation has two roots -0.381966 and -2.61803

Sample Output 2:

Enter the a, b, and c: 1.0 2.0 1.0
The equation has one root -1

Sample Output 3:

Enter the a, b, and c: 1.0 2.0 3.0
The equation has no real roots

Problem 03: Random Month (5 points)

NOTE: This program does not have user input.  Write a program which generates a random number between 1 and 
12 [1, 12], and displays the English month name corresponding to that number.  i.e. 1 would print January, 2 
would print February, and so on.

 

Problem 04: Today and Future Day (5 points)

Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer for today’s day of the week (Sunday is 0, Monday is 
1, …, and Saturday is 6). Also prompt the user to enter the number of days after today for a future 
day and display the future day of the week.

HINT: You will need to use the % operator to correctly compute the future day.

Sample Output 1:

Enter today's day: 1
Enter the number of days elapsed since today: 3

Today is Monday and the future day is Thursday.

Sample Output 2:

Enter today's day: 0
Enter the number of days elapsed since today: 31

Today is Sunday and the future day is Wednesday.

Problem 05: Time Calculator (5 points)

Write a program that asks the user to enter a number of seconds.

There are 60 seconds in a minute. If the number of seconds entered by the user is greater than or equal to 60, the program 
should display the number of minutes in that many seconds.
There are 3,600 seconds in an hour. If the number of seconds entered by the user is greater than or equal to 3,600, 
the program should display the number of hours in that many seconds.
There are 86,400 seconds in a day. If the number of seconds entered by the user is greater than or equal to 86,400, 
the program should display the number of days in that many seconds.
NOTE: It is possible for an entered value to fit all three condition, so code your selection statements accordingly.
