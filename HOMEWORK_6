Problem 03: MMO Slash Commands (15 points)

Popular MMO (massively multiplayer online) Games use "slash commands" in the in-game chat interface to perform 
various tasks.  These commands range from making your character "emote" (dance, laugh, etc) or roll random numbers,
or invite people to groups and so on.  Implement a simple chat interface that accepts slash commands and displays the 
required output.  A slash command starts with a forward slash followed by the command i.e. /dance.

Ask the user to enter their character name then display a chat prompt which is just the greater than sign >.  
The command will be entered after this prompt.

Implement the following commands.

/roll
This should generate and display a random number between [0, 100].
It should display the message <character_name> rolled a #.
/dance
Display the message "<character_name> performs a lively dance."
/invite <person_to_invite>
Display the message "<person_to_invite> has been invited to <character_name>'s party."
/say <something you want to say>
Display the message "<character_name> says <something you want to say>"
Input Validation:

If the command entered is not a valid command, display an error message and exit the program.
Requirements:

Assume character names will only be one word.
The commands must be entered all on one line.
Sample Output 1:

Enter your character name: Java_L337
> /roll
> Java_L337 rolled a 75.
Sample Output 2:

Enter your character name: Java_L337
> /dance
> Java_L337 performs a lively dance.
Sample Output 3:

Enter your character name: Java_L337
> /invite Python_Rulez
> Python_Rulez has been invited to Java_L337's party.
Sample Output 4:

Enter your character name: Java_L337
> /say Can I get a rez?
> Java_L337 says: Can I get a rez?
