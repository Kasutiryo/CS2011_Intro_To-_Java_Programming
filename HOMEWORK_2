Problem 01: Currency Converter (5 points)

Write a program that converts U.S. dollars to pounds, euros, and yen.  Use the following conversation rates:

1 dollar = 0.76 pounds
1 dollar = 0.89 euros
1 dollar = 101.88 yen

Your code must declare each conversion factor as a named constant.  Ask the user for an amount in dollars and show the resulting rates for each of the three currencies.

Sample Output:

Enter a dollar amount: 27.45

Pounds: 20.862
Euros: 24.4305
Yen: 2796.606

Problem 02: Compute the Volume of a Pyramid (5 points)

Write a program to compute the volume of a pyramid.  Ask the user for the length and width of the base, and the height 
of the pyramid.  Use the following formula:

area=(length)(width)area=(length)(width)

volume=13(area)(height)volume=13(area)(height)

Sample Output:

Enter the length, width, and height of a pyramid: 2.5 6.7 7.5 
The area is 16.75
The volume is 41.875

 

Problem 03: Distance Between Two Points (5 points)

Write a program that asks the user for the x and y values of two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).  Use the distance formula given 
below to display the distance between the two points:

distance=(x2−x1)2+(y2−y1)2−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−√distance=(x2−x1)2+(y2−y1)2

Sample Output:

Enter x1 and y1: 1.5 -3.4
Enter x2 and y2: 4.0 5.0

The distance between point (1.5, -3.4) and (4.0, 5.0) is: 8.764131445842194

Problem 04: Temperature Conversion

Design a program that asks the user for a temperature in Celsius.  The program should then convert the temperature 
to Fahrenheit and display the result.  Next, ask the user for a temperature in Fahrenheit and convert the value to Celsius
and display the result.

Formulas are given below:

fahrenheit=95celsius+32fahrenheit=95celsius+32

celsius=(fahrenheit−32)59celsius=(fahrenheit−32)59

 

Sample Output:

Enter a temperature in Celsius: 43
43 Celsius is 109.4 Fahrenheit

Enter a temperature in Fahrenheit: 89
89 Fahrenheit is 31.6667 Celsius

Problem 05: Separating a Decimal Value (5 points)

Write a program which asks the user to enter a floating-point number.  Split the number into its integer and fractional 
parts and display them separately.  This program can be tricky, but will have only a few lines of code.  Think through it carefully.

Sample Output:

Enter a floating-point value: 27.392175
Integer Part: 27
Fractional Part: 0.392175

NOTE: Due to the rounding error issue we discussed in class, your results for the Fractional Part may 
be slightly different from mine.  As long as your fractional part is very very close to mine, you should be
OK.  You might have extraneous decimal places due to rounding errors.
